abstract = "This paper introduces a cost-effective strategy to simulate the behavior of laminated plates by means of isogeometric 3D solid elements. Exploiting the high continuity of spline functions and their properties, a proper out-of-plane stress state is recovered from a coarse displacement solution using a post-processing step based on the enforcement of equilibrium in strong form. Appealing results are obtained and the method is shown to be particularly effective on slender composite stacks with a large number of layers. These are indeed the cases where traditional (e.g., “layerwise�?) approaches are more computationally heavy and where researchers are more inclined to look for alternatives, making the proposed method a very attractive solution."

abstract = "This paper develops a formulation for displacement-only beam elements based on isogeometric analysis, with intended application to laminated composite members. The main purpose of the current study was to overcome some deficiencies of commonly used beam theories, such as shear-locking, the lacking relevance of isotropic materials for multi-layer composites, the incompatibility with other continuum elements, and the limited continuity in interpolation. A bi-variable non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) beam element with complete plane-stress elasticity terms and geometrical expressions was developed. Shear-locking, interlaminar stresses, the deep-beam situation, and vibration features were evaluated for several aspect ratios, ply orientations, and NURBS degrees, in order to verify the efficiency and accuracy. h-, p- and k-refinements were used to improve the displacement field. The validity of the solutions was measured based on results from plane-stress finite element analysis, and compared to the alternative Carrera unified formulation. Results show that the isogeometric displacement-only beam theory can provide the interlaminar stress distribution, gives high accuracy for mid and high-range eigen-frequencies, and avoids the shear-locking phenomenon."

abstract = "Engineering applications in conventional numerical modeling are investigated by domain decomposition techniques because, generally, structural components do not have a regular shape. The most common and versatile numerical approach, in this regard, is the Finite Element (FE) method, which uses low order polynomials and the variational formulation for the solution of the differential problem. In contrast with the classic approach, the present paper shows a strong form collocation method for solving laminated composite plates wherein discontinuities arise. Both approaches need mapping technique for converting arbitrarily shaped elements into the computational space. Since the present strong form technique can deal with variable order approximating polynomials within each element, advanced blending function mapping must be employed for treating any discontinuity and distortion effect using the smallest number of elements. The Differential Quadrature (DQ) method is utilized for solving the mathematical problem and isogeometric mapping is implemented for the nonlinear mapping of complex shapes. The present methodology belongs to the framework of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), therefore this approach is termed Strong Formulation Isogeometric Analysis (SFIGA). Numerical applications show the accuracy, stability and reliability of the present methodology."
