In this paper an effective numerical approach is proposed to investigate
 static and dynamic isogeometric analysis using inverse hyperbolic shear
 deformation theory.

The manuscript is clearly written and the results are well presented.
 The results appear to be valid and the methodology is appropriate.

 Authors must compare the proposed theory with other advanced HSDTs with
 only four variables.
 A detailed literature review will provide the authors several papers that
 need to be included.

A comparision of the propsed IGA-IHSDT theory with advanced HSDTs with only
 four variable has been included and highlighted in section 4.2.2.
 Also a detailed literature review has been included in introduction section
 regarding same in and changes are highlighted using purple color text.

I strongly agree the publication of this paper after minor revision.
 This is a complete work.
 Authors should improve the state of art with recent non-polynomial shear
 deformation theories published in this journal and others.
 A detailed literature review will provide the authors several papers that
 need to be included.

Editor's Comments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As can be seen both the reviewers point to insufficient inclusion of relevant
 literature.
 I strongly recommend the authors to conduct a detailed literature review
 and fill this shortcomings.
 While both reviewers provided a list of papers to include, i decided not
 to include those here, in the interest of avoiding self-citation and bias
 from the reviewers - rather i would urge the authors to conduct your own
 literature review to address the reviewer comments.
