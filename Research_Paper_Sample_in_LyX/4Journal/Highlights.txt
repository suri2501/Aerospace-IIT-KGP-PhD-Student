Geometrically non-linear flexural analysis of laminated composite plate using inverse-hyperbolic and third-order shear deformation theories (IHSDT & TSDT).
Both von Karman and Greenâ€“Lagrange strain are considered for incorporation of geometric nonlinearity.
Importance of Green-Lagrange strain over von Karman strain is highlighted for movable simply supported and free boundary conditions.
Significance of penalty stiffness matrix  for thick anti-symmetric cross-ply laminate is also highlighted.
Selection of TSDT and IHSDT for anti-symmetric and symmetric laminated plate is emphasised.
