## For thesis writing
- Use [PHD thesis template for IIT KGP on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/phd-thesis-template-for-indian-institute-of-technology-kharagpur/dmwmpwsjpkyr)
- For more content space (which leads to less number of pages in the thesis) and less number of pages to print (economic)
- Add this code at line no. 52 (just before style) in the main.tex
    ```sh
    \addtolength{\textheight}{0.75in}
    \setlength{\floatsep}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    \setlength{\textfloatsep}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    \setlength{\intextsep}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    
    \usepackage{titlesec}
    \titlespacing\section{0pt}{5pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    \titlespacing\subsection{0pt}{5pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    \titlespacing\subsubsection{0pt}{5pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}{4pt plus 2pt minus 2pt}
    ```
