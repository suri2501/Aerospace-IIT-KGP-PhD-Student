\begin_layout Standard
The paper is good contribution to Science.
 However, the authors miss some important papers that introduce the term
 "Non-polynomial HSDT" in the literature.
 These papers originally introduce for example the tangential HSDT, optimized
 sinusoidal HSDT and much more.
 So, extensive survey on non-polynomial HSDTs should be made.

 As suggested by the reviewer, extensive survey on non-polynomial HSDT has
 been carried out.
 Papers pertaining to tangential-exponential, optimized sinusoidal, and
 others HSDTs have been included in section 1in the updated manuscript and
 the same has been highlighted with magenta color.

The authors are describing a nonlinear solution using FEM for polynomial
 and non-polynomial shear deformation theories.
 The aim is to compare deflections with Green-Lagrange and von Karman non
 linearities.
 Generally the manuscript is well presented and few remarks are needed to
 be answered in order to accept the contribution for publication.

— meaning of parameter gamma in Eq.
 10 should be provided.
 It seems Lagrange multiplier method has been applied but it is not clear
 as it is presented in the text, the penalty function method could be applied
 instead.
 Please give reference.

 Meaning of parameter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 in Eq.
 10 has been mentioned in the updated manuscript and the same has been highlight
ed.
 As suggested by the reviewer, the penalty function method has actually
 been applied for constraints energy approach and the same has been written
 in section 2.4 in the updated manuscript explicitly.
 All the additions have been highlighted with magenta color.

 A suitable reference [72] and important points have been added in section
 4.3 in the updated manuscript and the same has been highlighted with magenta
 color.

3— please explain why top and bottom boundary conditions for the transverse
 stresses are satisfied for the linear problem and they are not valid anymore
 for the nonlinear models.

 It is observed that the zero transverse stresses condition is satisfied
 through the linear strain-displacement relation due to orthotropic nature
 of the composite material.
 Moreover, this condition is also satisfied in von Kármán nonlinear model
 as well as linear model due to absence of nonlinear transverse strain-displacem
ent terms.
 However, due to the presence of nonlinear transverse strain terms in the
 Green-Lagrange nonlinear model, zero transverse stresses condition using
 constitutive approach is not satisfied at the top and bottom boundary condition.
 Hence, due to the strain-displacement approach and absence of nonlinear
 transverse strain terms in the strain-displacement relation, traction free
 boundary is satisfied only in linear and nonlinear von Kármán model.
